    "Based on our calculations, the Lump Sum investment strategy's final value was \\\\$70,508.94 and the DCA investment strategy's final value was \\\\$80,049.64, a difference of \\\\$9,540.70 in favor of the DCA strategy. We attribute this largely to the market returns viewable between the years of 2000 to 2003. This timeframe of investments (approx 18 months for the DCA strategy) occurred while the market returns were generally negative, meaning the value of the cash invested in the LS method was depreciating whilst the cash invested gradually in the DCA method worked to the investors benefit. Scaling into the position slowly helped lower the overall average entry price. The LS method was greatly affected by the timing in which the investment was made."

The LS method returned a final value of \\\\$114,237.48 while the DCA method returned a final value of \\\\$98,810.69. It's also interesting to note that both methods resulted in a higher final value when starting in 2003 relative to the final value when starting in 2000. As a result of moving the start date forward, the LS strategy's return grew by approximately 62\\% and the DCA strategy's return grew by approximately 23\\%. \n",

In this situation, the DCA method has a higher average entry price than the LS strategy because it is buying into higher and higher prices compared to the starting price that the LS strategy entered at. If the overall market return during the DCA period is negative, the DCA strategy will have a higher ending value since the average entry price will be lower than the LS strategy."
